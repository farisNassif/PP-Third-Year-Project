# PP-Third-Year-Project
Third year project for the Professional Practice in IT module

Current ideas include

1) Server/client multiplayer card game
2) Server/client multi user student chat room
3) App for tracking the real time location of busses | When busses are due at certain stops
4) Unity game FPS/Sidescroller/Very open options
5) Student personal checklist app for projects/deadlines (Similar to bugtracker app)

Languages are very open, with a prefernece in Java / C, a lower priority on something like the Ionic framework/Angular and Languages like C#/Python are really not preferred.

All in all any language/app will be doable with enough of our time commited to it
