# PP-Third-Year-Project
Third year project for the Professional Practice in IT module
Cormac Raftery & Faris Nassif

For our group project we decided to make a programme which consists of multiple server-client card games.
To date we have completed a game called war which we had to do in c++ for a project in 2nd year but have now converted it to java and will now convert it to a server-client game before moving onto a new game.
